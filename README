20-sim has a C-Code Generator which automatically converts a complete 20-sim model or submodel into C-Code.

= INSTALL =
The template for this repository allow to generate code that could be used inside of the OROCOS RTT framework.
To install the template( copy content of the git repository into Ccode folder )
 cd %PATH_TO_20_SIM%/Ccode
 git clone https://YuryBrodskiy@github.com/YuryBrodskiy/20SimRTTCodeGeneration.git

Please use 20-Sim version > 4.1.2.4

= USAGE =
To use the code generation feature in 20-sim go to 'Model->Start Simulator' to open a new simulator window. Then from the simulator window go to menu 'Tools-> Real Time Toolbox -> C-Code Generation' to display a window with list of templates. Choose OROCOS component.

= ADVANCED FEATURES = 
Important element of a generated component is possibility of influence configuration parameters  and communication ports after the code was generated.

The configuration of the created component is described by XML file created at the moment of code generation.
The configuration  XML contains following:
+ Initial values required to correctly start computation
	+Initial state of the component
	+Configuration of the computation
+ Description of the component interface
	+Input/Output ports -> Data flow communication
	+Configuration properties -> Runtime introspection, runtime changes of configuration
+ Other information about the computation model, e.g.  physical quantities (not in use at the moment)
